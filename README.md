# 🍽️ University Mensa Simulation Web Application

A full-stack web application that simulates and improves the university cafeteria (Mensa) reservation system.

Developed as a Web Programming course project at the University of Messina.

This project was fully developed from scratch without using AI-generated code.

## 📌 About The Project

This project was designed to solve real-world problems in the university Canteen system, such as:

- Long queues during peak hours  
- Lack of meal availability transparency  
- No demand forecasting for daily meals  
- Inefficient reservation management  

The system allows students to reserve meals in advance and enables Canteen staff to manage menus and monitor reservations effectively.

This project was fully developed from scratch without using AI-generated code.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern:

- **Model** → Handles database logic  
- **View** → User interface layer  
- **Controller** → Business logic  
- **Router** → Manages routes and requests  

Front-end and back-end are fully separated for better scalability and maintainability.
